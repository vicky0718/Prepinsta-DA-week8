# Prepinsta-DA-week8
Capstone Project of Data Analytics Internship
Overview
This GitHub repository houses the comprehensive code and data for a fitness tracking dashboard project. The project's journey begins with the meticulous cleaning and merging of individual CSV files using Google Colab. This initial step ensures that the data is prepared for the subsequent exploratory data analysis (EDA), conducted both theoretically and visually.

# Exploration and Analysis
The merged datasets offer a rich source of insights, paving the way for detailed exploratory data analysis. Theoretical examinations alongside visualizations bring to light patterns, trends, and correlations within the fitness tracking data. Individual profiles for daily, hourly, and minute-based activities are generated using Panda Profiles, providing a deeper understanding of user behaviors.
